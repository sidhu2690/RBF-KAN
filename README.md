# RBF-KAN
This code implements a Radial Basis Function (RBF) based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for function approximation. The network consists of several layers, including RBF kernel activation layers and ReLU layers.

The code generates a synthetic dataset consisting of a sinusoidal function with added noise. The dataset is then converted to PyTorch tensors and fed into the network for training using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss.
After training, the network's performance is evaluated by plotting the ground truth function and the predicted function on the same graph.
There are a lot of possibilities to tune and improve this model, as this is just a very basic implementation of an RBF-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network. Here are some potential improvements and additional considerations:

Hyper-parameter tuning: The number of centers, learning rate, and other hyper-parameters can be tuned to optimize the model's performance. This can be done using techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization.
Initialization strategies: Instead of random initialization, more sophisticated techniques like k-means clustering or gradient-based initialization can be used to initialize the RBF centers and weights.
Regularization: Techniques like L1/L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping can be employed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Architecture modifications: The number of layers, the types of layers (e.g., convolutional layers, attention mechanisms), and the connections between layers can be modified to better suit the problem at hand.
Transfer learning: Pre-trained models or pre-trained RBF centers can be used as a starting point for the network, which can potentially lead to faster convergence and better performance.
Ensemble methods: Multiple models can be trained and combined using ensemble techniques like bagging or boosting to improve the overall predictive performance.
Advanced optimization techniques: More advanced optimization algorithms, such as adaptive learning rate methods or second-order optimization methods, can be explored to improve convergence speed and final performance.
Interpretability and explainability: Techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can be used to interpret and explain the behavior of the RBF-based KAN, which can be valuable in many applications.
Domain-specific modifications: Depending on the specific application domain (e.g., time series forecasting, computer vision, natural language processing), domain-specific modifications or architectural changes may be required to better capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.
